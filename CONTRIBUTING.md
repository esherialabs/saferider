# Contributing to SafeRide

Thank you for helping improve SafeRide. The project welcomes public issues,
documentation changes, tests, accessibility work, and focused code
contributions through `https://github.com/esherialabs/saferide`.

SafeRide handles unusually sensitive safety, evidence, and location workflows.
Protecting people takes priority over convenience or speed.

## Before you contribute

- Read `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `GOVERNANCE.md`, and
  `docs/open-source/restricted-material.md`.
- Search existing issues and the public project board before opening a new one.
- Use synthetic examples only. Never submit survivor or participant details,
  evidence, exact private locations, credentials, raw prompts/completions,
  private security findings, consent/event logs, or partner-confidential data.
- Report vulnerabilities privately through GitHub Security Advisories rather
  than a public issue.
- Keep capability and privacy wording truthful. Do not solve implementation
  gaps by weakening warnings or making unsupported readiness claims.

## Development setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/esherialabs/saferide.git
cd saferide
npm ci
npm --prefix apps/api ci
cp .env.example .env.local
cp infra/local/.env.example infra/local/.env
npx tsc --noEmit
npm --prefix apps/api run typecheck
npm test
```

The local stack is described in `docs/migration/local-setup.md`. Do not use
production credentials or real records in development.

## Issues

Use the supplied issue forms. A good issue states the affected public revision,
uses a synthetic reproduction, defines expected behavior, and identifies any
safety, privacy, accessibility, or compatibility impact.

Issues suitable for new contributors carry the `good first issue` label. A
maintainer may reserve an issue before substantial work begins.

## Pull requests

1. Fork the public repository and branch from `main`.
2. Keep the change focused on one public issue.
3. Add or update tests and public documentation where behavior changes.
4. Run the smallest relevant checks, plus:

   ```bash
   npx tsc --noEmit
   npm --prefix apps/api run typecheck
   npm run secrets:scan
   npm test
   ```

5. Include behavior, safety/privacy impact, verification, limitations, and
   rollback notes in the pull request.
6. Add a `Signed-off-by:` line using `git commit -s` to certify the Developer
   Certificate of Origin 1.1.

Release, model, privacy, security, and safeguarding changes require the
independent reviews described in `GOVERNANCE.md`. Maintainers may port an
accepted public contribution into the private release-integration repository
before it appears in the next generated public snapshot.
