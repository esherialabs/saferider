## Current release posture

SafeRide v0.5.8 is an Android controlled-testing preview. It has physical-device
evidence for model download, pause/resume, verification, restart persistence,
and synthetic chat on one arm64 device. It is not a production,
survivor-facing, emergency-service, Google Play, or UNICEF-approved release.

Use synthetic data for every development, test, issue, and demonstration flow.
